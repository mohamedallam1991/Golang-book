You already know that you will never be done learning. But most people “learn in private”, and lurk. They consume content without creating any themselves. Again, that’s fine, but we’re here to talk about being in the top quintile. What you do here is to have **a habit of creating learning exhaust:**


- Write [blogs](https://mohamedallam.tech) and [tutorials](https://laravelexample.com) and cheatsheets.
- Speak at meetups and conferences. [Invite me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohamedallam1991/).
- Ask and answer things on Stackoverflow or Reddit. Avoid the walled gardens like Slack and Discord, or [Telegram](https://t.me/kindatired) they’re not public.
- Make [Youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR1c1Y6c7Q7HPJLjtBWy71g) or Twitch streams.
- Start a newsletter.
- Draw cartoons (people loooove cartoons!).
